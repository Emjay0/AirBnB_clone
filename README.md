This is a project about creating a clone of AirBnB.

To run the AirBnB command interpreter in interactive 
mode simply run the console.py file, e.g : ./console.py
Once in interactive mode you can use commands.

To run the AirBnB command interpreter in non-interactive mode, 
'echo' the command you wish you use and pipe it into running the 
console.py file. e.g: echo "help" | ./console.py
